## 1.1 Source of data
__- Primary:__
1. Observation studies
2. Surveys
3. Experiment

__- Secondary:__  
1. Distributed by Organisations
2. Commercial or freely available
----
## 1.2 Four scales of measurement
1. Nominal  (*Qualitative = not numerical*)
	**Name/Label**
2. Ordinal ~[Order]~ (*Qualitative*)
	%% e.g. Happiness level
3. Interval (*Quantitative*)
	**Different “zero”; order known; differences between values known**
	%% e.g. Celsius scale VS Farenheiht;
4. Ratio(*Quantitative*)
	**Quantitative; order known; differences between values known, “true zero”**
	%% e.g. Weight: 20kg is twice 10kg, also have: 20 pounds is twice 10 pounds.

**~Difference between Ordinal & Interval: ~**
*- ¿Can quantify the differences between each value?*
*- ¿Can add or subtract values?*

## 1.3 Data and its Representation
### For Qualitative data:
1. Bar graph:
	(img)
	**Gaps; Axis labels**
2. Pie charts:
	**Hard to read; labels with % symbol**

### For Quantitative data:
- Stem and Leaf plot:
	(img)
### Numerical data:
- Histograms:
	**Bars have no gaps; with axis labels**
- Scatter plot 2 variables: x and y
	(img)
	**Points show datas; fitted line shows linear relationships**
- Time Series plot:
	(img)
	**Time is always on the horizon label**
	%% E.g. :
	%% There is a strong positive
	%% linear relationship (income increases with prestige of the job).
	%% However, some points are far away from the line (they are outliers)
## 1.4 Describing Distributions
Three aspects are required to mention when describing distributions:
>- Central Tendency.
>- Spread
>- Skew
1. Measures of central tendency:
	1.  **Mean:**  _平均数_
	2. **Median:** _中位数_
	3. **Mode:** _众数_
	4.  **Quartiles:** _ “25%”_
		(img)
		**Lower quartile Q1; Upper quartile Q3**
2. Spread:
	1. **Range:** *Diff biggest &smallest numbers*
	2. Interquartile range **IQR**: *Diff between Q3 and Q1*
	3. Variance ~s^2~ and Standard deviation ~s~:
		(img)
		(img)
	> *The bigger s^2 and s is, the array numbers are more widely spread about Mean number of the array*
3. Shape:
	1. **Skewness: ** _倾斜程度（偏向）_
	2. **Number of modes:** _极 数（众数的个数）_
	3. **Outlier** _异值_ Outside the main tendency. (Far from the bulk of the data)
		*It may be experimental error; the point is sometimes excluded from the data set.*
